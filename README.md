### Before using the script, you need to install the wkhtmltopdf binaries!

If you're lucky (got all dependencies) you can try: <code>sudo apt-get install wkhtmltopdf</code>

If you're not, use these instructions: https://computingforgeeks.com/install-wkhtmltopdf-on-ubuntu-debian-linux/

or check the links below for precompiled binaries

**Windows/Mac**

If you're on windows or mac, last releases are here:

## Usage

Go to the script directory then type:

By default the output will be a file named outputX.pdf in the same directory (output.pdf or output{number} if the old filename already exists)
